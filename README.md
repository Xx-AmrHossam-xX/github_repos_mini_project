# github_repos_mini_project

This is a create-react-app mini project that uses React.js,React Hooks and more.It lists the most starred Github repos created in the last 30 days (relative to 2017-11-22).

### Why React.js ?
React utilizes its virtual DOM to update only the necessary parts of the DOM which significantly improves the perfomance and since this mini project updates data on the DOM , i find React.js to be a logical choice.

### How to start ?

 * clone
 * npm install
 * npm audit fix ( optional )
 * npm start
